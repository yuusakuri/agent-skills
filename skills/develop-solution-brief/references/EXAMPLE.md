# Solution Brief: Streamlined Mobile Checkout

## Problem Recap

Mobile shoppers abandon checkout at a 73% rate, significantly higher than desktop's 45%. Users cite confusing multi-step flows, small form fields, and unexpected shipping costs as primary frustrations. This represents a $177M annual revenue opportunity.

## Proposed Solution

We will redesign mobile checkout as a single-page experience with progressive disclosure. Instead of navigating through multiple screens, shoppers will complete their purchase on one streamlined page that expands sections as needed. The design prioritizes large touch targets, saved payment methods, and upfront shipping transparency.

## Key Features

1. **Single-Page Checkout:** All checkout steps visible on one page with accordion sections that expand/collapse. Users always see their progress and can edit any section without losing data.

2. **Express Payment Options:** Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal one-tap buttons prominently displayed at top. Returning customers can checkout in under 30 seconds.

3. **Upfront Shipping Calculator:** Shipping costs displayed based on cart contents before checkout begins. No surprise costs at the final step.

4. **Smart Form Fields:** Large, mobile-optimized input fields with auto-formatting (phone, credit card). Address autocomplete via Google Places API reduces typing by 70%.

5. **Guest Checkout Persistence:** Cart and partially-entered information saved for 7 days, allowing users to return and complete purchase without starting over.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Mobile checkout abandonment | 73% | 60% | Q1 2026 |
| Mobile checkout completion time | 4.2 min | 2.0 min | Q1 2026 |
| Express payment adoption | 0% | 25% | Q2 2026 |

## Trade-offs Considered

| What We're Not Doing | Why |
|---------------------|-----|
| Removing guest checkout | Legal requirement in EU markets; also helps first-time buyers |
| Cross-sell/upsell in checkout | User research shows this adds friction; moving to cart instead |
| Custom payment form design | Payment provider contract limits changes until March |
| Cryptocurrency payment | Low demand (<1% of requests); complexity not justified |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Apple Pay integration delays | Medium | High | Parallel-path with card-only fallback; engage Apple early |
| Page load performance on single-page | Medium | Medium | Lazy-load sections; aggressive image optimization |
| User confusion with accordion UX | Low | Medium | A/B test against step-based alternative; quick iteration |
